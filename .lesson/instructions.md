This assignment is designed to help you work on building your own programs/tools in Java.
*You may use any IDE or programming tools you like, but you must submit through the repl.it*
## Instructions:
Write a program that takes in user input as well as displays information about real word objects/ideas. Your program should be able to take in and store several pieces of information and recall information requested by the user.
## Requirements:
1. Your code must be well organized and readable with comments where needed. You will be presenting your code to your classmates.
0. Outputs must be well organized and readable with clear labels for information.
0. You must have an array of objects (strings and wrappers are allowed, but user defined objects are better)
0. Users must be able to create, read, update and delete data from the array (CRUD).
